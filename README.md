Hi, I made a simple style to look at blaseball games easier. It has:

 - Reduced spacing between and around everything
 - Collapsed sidebar and schedule (expands on hover)
 - No gradients or rounded corners
 - No user email on sidebar
 - Game log font changed from monospace to regular to be easier on the eyes
 - Flattened field graphic (this is personal preference)
 
 This was designed to use on a half-screen so it's pretty compact, but is responsive so it'll look nice on a full screen zoomed in too.
